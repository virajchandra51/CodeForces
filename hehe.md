# CP-31 v3 new features? Here’s what’s new.

CP-31 was born from the most common question we heard. What should I practice today to actually get better in Competitive Programming?

Most people spend months jumping between random problem lists, hoping something clicks. It doesn't. They stay stuck, frustrated, solving problems but never improving.

CP-31 changes that. It's a rating-wise ladder that shows you the most important patterns in the right order, at the right difficulty. Our main goal was simple: to introduce you to the **maximum number of ideas while solving the minimum number of problems at each rating**.

Today, CP-31 is trusted by 100,000++ competitive programmers worldwide.

And now, after all your love and support, we're upgrading it to Version 3, making it even better. But before we dive into what's new in v3, here's a quick look at what made CP-31 click for thousands of learners. You can directly jump to the v3 features from the navigation if youʼre already familiar with CP-31.

# What Made CP-31 Work Before v3?
1. **Rating-wise ladders from 800 to 1900**  
31 hand-picked Codeforces problems, each read and vetted by experienced coders (Candidate Master+) to ensure quality and reduce bias at each rating band, so learners progress by difficulty, not by scattered topics. These problems don't just teach you something interesting. They teach you something reusable.

2. **Curated for modern contest ideas**  
These aren't random problems. Each one trains you on a technique that appears in actual contests: greedy thinking, binary search conditions, two-pointer flows, DP state design, graph fundamentals, number theory concepts, segment trees, and clever implementations.

3. **Video solutions for every problem**  
Each problem till 1500 rating comes with a step by step video explanation. Understand the ‘whyʼ behind every move, so the logic stays with you. You learn how to approach problems, not just memorise patterns.

4. **Codeforces progress sync**  
Sync your Codeforces handle once, and your progress updates automatically.

5. **Discussion section**  
A discussion section similar to LeetCode, so that you can share approaches, ask doubts, and learn from othersʼ solutions.

6. **Notes section**  
Save your insights, patterns, and key takeaways as you solve. Build your own reference library that grows with every problem you crack.

7. **Report a bug**  
Spotted something off? Report it directly. We're constantly improving based on what the community notices and needs.

8. **Free to access**  
CP-31 is completely free. No paywall, no premium features. Anyone can start practising without paying anything.

# Now, introducing CP-31 v3

We kept the backbone that worked and rebuilt the experience where it could be faster, clearer, and more motivating day-to-day. Hereʼs whatʼs new in v3 and why it matters.

---

## 1. Practice Heatmap & Streaks

We added a daily heatmap where each square represents a day. The darker the colour, the more problems you solved. Solved 5+ problems in a day? You'll see a 🔥 fire badge marking your most focused days.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/537fd510-49e3-4ae3-aecd-af91ce652194-CP31 V3 - 1.png" style="max-width:90%;height:auto;">
</div>


You'll also see your current AC streak and longest streak, counting every day you solved at least one problem. It's a simple way to keep yourself accountable.

Use the Global vs CP-31 toggle to switch views:
- **Global** shows all your Codeforces activity.
- **CP-31** shows only problems from the CP-31 ladder.

Hover over any day to see exactly how many problems you solved. Once your Codeforces account is synced, the heatmap updates automatically. No extra setup needed.

We've also added a Visit Streak Calendar that tracks how many consecutive days you've opened CP-31. Even if you don't solve anything, just visiting keeps your streak alive. It's one more way to stay consistent and build a daily habit.

## 2. Hints That Help You Think, Not Just Copy

Competitive programming is all about training your brain to explore possibilities and build problem-solving instincts. Watching direct solutions can short-circuit this process. You might understand the code, but you miss the thinking that led you there.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/618b8b76-bb81-4b6c-8db9-5787f88e1627-CP31 V3 - 2.png" style="max-width:65%;height:auto;">
</div>
That's exactly why we built progressive hints into v3. They guide your thinking without giving away the answer, so you preserve the "aha!" moment that makes ideas stick.

You start with a problem. If something doesn't click, you request Hint 1, and your brain gets a nudge to work with. It thinks, connects dots, and develops its own ideas. If you're still stuck, Hint 2 reveals the approach you should try, or Hint 3 provides the full picture a complete roadmap with key steps and common pitfalls.

Once you've worked through the hints, watch the video for a full walkthrough. Then check the code to verify your solution.

Each hint opens in a clean, expandable card with 👍/👎 buttons for quick feedback.

## 3. Concept Tags & Bookmarks

Every problem now shows a Concept tag right next to the title, like Greedy Swaps, Two Pointers, Binary Search, DP on Arrays, or Graph BFS. It tells you the main idea of the problem before you even start.

It gives you a hint about which direction you should take for your implementation. You know what technique you're practising upfront. And after solving, the concept tag makes it easier to remember what you learned.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/ebce8bc5-4765-49a7-a767-16c08e377c61-CP31 V3 - 4.png" style="max-width:90%;height:auto;">
</div>

We have also added a bookmark button, so that you can bookmark questions that you think you should revisit later.

## 4. Multi-Language Code Solutions

One common issue learners face is language barriers. Most editorials and solutions online are in C++, which can be frustrating if you compete in Java or Python.

That's why in v3, every problem now includes C++, Java, and Python implementations of the same algorithm. All three languages come with:

- Detailed comments explaining every key step.
- Time complexity analysis.
- Space complexity breakdown.

Whether you code in C++, Java, or Python, you can learn the approach in the language you're most comfortable with.

## 5. Focus Mode (Solve Without Distractions)

You choose when to open each step. One-tap controls let you pause, reset, or mark the problem as solved when you're done. It keeps you in deep work, no tab hopping or distractions. Delayed hints protect your aha! moment and improve how well ideas stick. And the light time pressure builds real contest stamina.

When you're practising, it's easy to get distracted by checking hints too early, hopping between tabs, or giving up too quickly. You don't build the stamina or focus you need for actual contests.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/e2c9b01c-5f13-4fa1-a369-2ddb6e2ebd31-CP31 V3 - 6.png" style="max-width:90%;height:auto;">
</div>
That's why we built Focus Mode. Sit down, hit Start, and just solve. Focus Mode gives you a clean workspace with a timer, progress bar, and guided hints that unlock gradually so you think first and learn the idea, not just the answer.

Once you start the timer, you get a 50-minute window tracked by a progress bar. Help unlocks progressively:

- Hint 1 at 20 minutes
- Hint 2 at 30 minutes
- Hint 3 at 40 minutes
- Video solution at 50 minutes

You choose when to open each step. One tap controls let you pause, reset, or mark the problem as solved when you're done. It keeps you in deep work, no tab-hopping or distractions.

## 6. Optimised Leaderboard.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/15106997-6556-49a7-b8d5-d26aeed300b8-CP31 V3 - 3.png" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
</div>
Weʼve added a leaderboard because a little friendly competition keeps you accountable and motivated to stay consistent. You can search by username or institute name, and view both all-time and recent rankings to see where you stand.

---

## 7. Social media template

We know you love sharing your competitive programming journey, and we love reading about it. That's why we've added a new social media template. Once you complete all 31 problems of a rating, you can share your achievement on LinkedIn, X, and other platforms, along with your overall experience.
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://tle-common-production.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/frontend-service/blog-assets/7a574a11-ff4c-4991-805a-b288c979f585/3268d3d9-f5ef-4232-9105-ad68d98e1caf-WhatsApp Image 2025-11-10 at 20.19.47_d601e922.jpg" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
</div>
Also, we can't believe how many times you guys asked for this, but we've added Dark Mode to the entire sheet. I'm pretty sure most of you will be happier about this than everything else we just announced. Anyway, your late-night grinding sessions just got a whole lot easier on the eyes. 🎉

This is it for CP-31. That's it. That's everything we've built. We've been working on this for months, late nights, endless testing, rewriting features until they felt right. All because we wanted to give you something better. Something that actually helps. We won't be making major changes to the sheet after this. We're working on courses, new resources, and other things to help this CP community grow bigger and stronger. CP-31 will stay here, exactly as it is in v3, ready to guide anyone who needs it. If you've been with us since the beginning, thank you. If you're just discovering CP-31 now welcome. Either way, we're glad you're here. Now go solve. Stay consistent. And keep levelling up. We'll be here, building the next thing.
